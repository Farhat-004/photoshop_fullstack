# PhotoBooth **Full-Stack** Project (MERN)

PhotoBooth is a **React-based social media web application**.  
It converts existing static HTML templates (`login.html`, `register.html`, `profile.html`, etc.) into fully dynamic, functional pages with **JWT Authentication**, **REST API integration**, and **stateful UI interactions** — closely resembling a real-world social platform (Instagram).

---

## Features Overview

### Authentication

-   Users can **register** via `/register` and **log in** via `/login`.
-   Authentication is handled using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
-   Unauthorized users are restricted in certain areas (e.g., limited post visibility).

---

### Home Page (`/`)

-   Displays all user posts.
-   Implements **Infinite Scrolling** — loads 10 posts per API page as the user scrolls down.
-   For **unauthenticated users**, only **3–4 posts** are shown.
    -   Once scrolled to the bottom, a **custom login/register popup** appears.
-   Each post shows:
    -   Image
    -   Caption (with “Show More / Show Less” toggle for long captions)
    -   Like count
    -   Comment count
    -   Time of posting

---

### Post Interactions

-   Authenticated users can:
    -   **Like (Love React)** posts
    -   **Comment** on posts
    -   **Share** posts (copies the post link to clipboard)
-   Unauthenticated users can **view posts** but not **like or comment** — clicking these triggers the **login/register popup**.
-   “View all comments” opens the **Post Details Page**.

---

### Post Details Page (`/posts/:id`)

-   Displays the full post, all comments, and like information.
-   Users can:
    -   Add, edit, or delete comments.
    -   View a **list of users who liked** the post.
-   Includes a **"More from this user"** section — showing more posts from the same author.

---

### Profile System

-   Clicking any username navigates to that user’s **Profile Page**.
-   Profile page renders:
    -   Profile photo
    -   Bio
    -   Website
    -   Gender
    -   User posts
-   If the logged-in user visits **their own profile**, they will see an **“Edit Profile”** button.

---

### Edit Profile Page

-   Allows the user to:
    -   Update profile picture
    -   Edit website, bio, gender, and password
-   **Password Strength Indicator**:
    -   Weak → Red
    -   Fair → Orange
    -   Medium → Yellow
    -   Strong → Green

---

### Create Post Page

-   Accessible via the **Create** button in the sidebar.
-   Users can upload an image and write a caption.
-   Both image and caption are **required fields**.
-   Includes proper **validation and error handling** for all inputs.

---

### Notification Page

-   Fetches notifications from the API (via GET requests).
-   Displays notifications for:
    -   Likes
    -   Comments
-   Clicking a notification navigates to the **corresponding Post Details page**.
-   No real-time updates — notifications are fetched on demand.

---

### Navigation System

-   A **Side Navigation Bar** is visible on all pages except **Login** and **Register**.
-   Menu items:
    -   Home
    -   Notifications
    -   Create Post
    -   Profile
-   The active route is always highlighted.
-   Navigation is **persistent** and **shared across the app**.

---

## Core Functionalities

-   **JWT-based Authentication** for login and registration.
-   **REST API Integration** for all CRUD operations.
-   **Pagination + Infinite Scroll** for smooth performance.
-   **Post Like, Comment, Share** system.
-   **Conditional Rendering** based on authentication state.
-   **Custom Popup Modal** for login/register prompts.
-   **State Management** for loading, error, and success states.
-   **Reusable UI Components** following given templates.
-   **Consistent Theme & Design** with provided assets.

---

## Validation & Error Handling

-   Every form includes **client-side validation**.
-   Uses **custom loading indicators** and **error messages**.
-   Ensures UI consistency across all pages and interactions.

## Note

This project is created for **educational purposes** as part of a frontend assignment. Later it was updated to Full-Stack project by developing a new backend with Express and MongoDB.
All API routes and HTML templates are created by own following another backend.
